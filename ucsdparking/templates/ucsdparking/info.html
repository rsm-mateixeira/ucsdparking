    <div class="body-about">
        <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Welcome to our comprehensive project, a pivotal component of 
            the 'Collecting and Analyze Large Data' course at the University of California - San Diego, Rady School of Management. 
            This initiative is not just an academic exercise; it's a practical solution tailored to 
            enhance the daily experiences of our university community. By meticulously gathering and 
            examining extensive parking lot inventory data, we aim to shed light on the fluctuating 
            demands of park usage throughout the year. Our objective is to provide actionable insights 
            that facilitate better planning and resource allocation for students and staff alike. 
            Delve into our detailed analysis and discover how we're harnessing the power of big data 
            to foster a more efficient and accommodating campus environment.
            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2">Data</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">After comprehensive research, our team has procured an extensive dataset detailing parking lot occupancy across 
                the UCSD campuses in La Jolla and Hillcrest. This rich dataset encompasses a decade-long survey of parking spaces, 
                capturing hourly occupancy details from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Thursday. Spanning from 2000 to the present, 
                it offers an in-depth view of parking dynamics over the years.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">For our analysis, we focused on data post-2018, providing us with a unique opportunity to examine the impact of the 
                COVID-19 pandemic on campus parking trends. Our approach involved dissecting the data by various categories 
                including individual lots, structures, neighborhoods, areas, and specific locations. This granular analysis 
                allows for a nuanced understanding of parking occupancy patterns during this unprecedented period.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">You can access and explore the dataset used for this project <a href="https://rmp-wapps.ucsd.edu/TS/Survey/Parking%20Space%20Inventory/Quarterly%20Tables/Contents.html" target="_blank" style="color: white;">here</a>.</p>
            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2">Methodology</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">In the initial phase of this project, we employed Python-based web scraping techniques to meticulously gather all relevant 
                files from the specified website. This was followed by an intricate data cleansing process, during which we reformatted and 
                restructured the data to align with our desired specifications. Given the unique and varying structures of the Excel files 
                for each year and quarter, this task predominantly involved manual manipulation, utilizing both Excel and Power Query for 
                optimal efficiency.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Subsequent to the data refinement, we leveraged the Django framework, a sophisticated Python tool, to develop and construct the website. 
                This phase was marked by a focus on integrating functionality with an intuitive user interface. Finally, we designed and implemented 
                a series of comprehensive dashboards using Tableau. These dashboards were seamlessly integrated into the website, providing an 
                interactive and visually engaging user experience.
