            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2">Use Case 1</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">After comprehensive research, our team has procured an extensive dataset detailing parking lot occupancy across 
                the UCSD campuses in La Jolla and Hillcrest. This rich dataset encompasses a decade-long survey of parking spaces, 
                capturing hourly occupancy details from 8 a.m. to 5 p.m., Monday through Thursday. Spanning from 2000 to the present, 
                it offers an in-depth view of parking dynamics over the years.</p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">
                For our analysis, we focused on data post-2018, providing us with a unique opportunity to examine the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic on campus parking trends.
                 Our approach involved dissecting the data by various categories including individual lots, structures, neighborhoods, areas, and specific locations. 
                 This granular analysis allows for a nuanced understanding of parking occupancy patterns during this unprecedented period. Importantly, the data we analyzed 
                 is based on one day of observation per parking lot per quarter, with observations taken every hour of that day. This approach ensures a comprehensive view of 
                 parking dynamics over different times and seasons.</p>
            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2">Use Case 2</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">In the initial phase of this project, we employed Python-based web scraping techniques to meticulously gather all relevant 
                files from the specified website. This was followed by an intricate data cleansing process, during which we reformatted and 
                restructured the data to align with our desired specifications. Given the unique and varying structures of the Excel files 
                for each year and quarter, this task predominantly involved manual manipulation, utilizing both Excel and Power Query for 
                optimal efficiency.

            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Subsequent to the data refinement, we leveraged the Django framework, a sophisticated Python tool, to develop and construct the website. 
                This phase was marked by a focus on integrating functionality with an intuitive user interface. Finally, we designed and implemented 
                a series of comprehensive dashboards using Tableau. These dashboards were seamlessly integrated into the website, providing an 
                interactive and visually engaging user experience.
