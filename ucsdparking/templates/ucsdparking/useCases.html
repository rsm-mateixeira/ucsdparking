            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">This tool would be well suited for integration with the UCSD parking services website, as it is it utilizes their interactive map to find specific 
                parking lots available to students as well as information regarding their permit types, if UCSD Parking decided to integrate this tool they could 
                directly filter by permit type based on availability to search for lots with more than X% of spots expected to be available at a given time to help 
                individuals decide whether or not to purchase a parking pass for use at that time, or whether they would be better off finding other options for 
                transportation.

                UCSD is a constantly expanding campus, even now new development is going on all throughout campus and extending its borders. As more and more 
                students and faculty come to UCSD, more parking will be needed, and the school could use this information to find out which lots are currently 
                struggling with providing adequate parking, as well as which lots are currently being under-utilized. With this information, they could take 
                proactive steps to increase parking in the more heavily impacted areas of campus, as well as potentially use the area around the underutilized 
                lots for other purposes, such as new buildings or dorms.</p>
