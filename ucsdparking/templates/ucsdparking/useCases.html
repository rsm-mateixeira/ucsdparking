            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">A faculty member at UCSD plans to schedule a meeting with students and other staff members at the Geisel Library.
                They use the website to check the availability of parking spaces in lots close to the Rady School of Management. 
                By viewing the dashboard, they can determine the best time to schedule the meeting, ensuring that all attendees will find parking conveniently. 
                This tool also allows students and staff to plan their campus visits efficiently, selecting times when parking spaces are more readily available.</p>
            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2" style="font-size: 50px; color: white;">Use Case Rady School of Management</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">Parents visiting their child at UCSD for a special event at the Rady School of Management utilize the 
                website to check parking lot availability. They choose the years and quarters from the options in the list, related to the date of their visit to 
                view the average availability of the parking lots, parking spaces and at the hours of the day selected. This information helps them to plan their 
                visit better, ensuring they arrive on time for the event. They got a permit of visitor from the permits website, so it's important to check the 
                availability of this parking spaces.
            </p>
            <h1 class="titlesPagesAbouth2" style="font-size: 50px; color: white;">Large Scale Use Cases</h1>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">This tool would be well suited for integration with the UCSD parking services website, as it utilizes their 
                interactive map to find specific parking lots available to students as well as information regarding their permit types. If UCSD Parking decided to 
                integrate this tool, they could directly filter by permit type based on availability to search for lots with more than X% of spots expected to be 
                available at a given time to help individuals decide whether or not to purchase a parking pass for use at that time, or whether they would be better 
                off finding other options for transportation.
            </p>
            <p style="font-size: 20px; text-align: center;">For UCSD Campus planning, this tool's integration could serve as a valuable asset in the future development 
                of parking. With UCSD's ongoing expansion and the increase in student and faculty numbers, more parking will inevitably be needed. Utilizing data from 
                this tool, the school can identify which parking lots are facing challenges in providing adequate parking and which are underutilized. This information 
                would enable proactive steps to increase parking in areas with high demand and potentially repurpose areas around underutilized lots for new buildings, 
                dorms, or other campus needs.</p>
